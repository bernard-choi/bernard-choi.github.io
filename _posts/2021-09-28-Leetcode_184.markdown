Explanation: Max and Jom both have the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department

## 2. 풀이

- Case문으로 1인 경우 `IT`, 2인 경우 `Sales`로 바꿔준다. 
- Group by로 max값을 뽑으면 `IT` 부서에서 `Jim`만 뽑힌다. Inner Join을 통해 `Jim`, `Max` 모두 뽑아야 한다. 
  - `Departmentid`, `Salary의 max값` 두 컬럼을 추출한 후 원래 raw table에 inner join한다. 

```SQL
SELECT
	CASE
		WHEN e.departmentid = 1 THEN 'IT'
		WHEN e.departmentid = 2 THEN 'Sales'
	END AS Department,
	e.Name AS Employee,
	e.Salary AS Salary
FROM
	employee AS e
INNER JOIN (
	SELECT
		DepartmentId,
		MAX(Salary) AS max_salary
	FROM
		EMPLOYEE
	GROUP BY
		DepartmentId) AS sub ON
	e.DepartmentId = sub.DepartmentId
	AND e.salary = sub.max_salary;
```
